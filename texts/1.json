    "content": "It should be clearer now what I was getting at when I said \n that while Mauss's gifts are caught up in the specific social identity \n of their givers and receivers (their exterior \"image,\" one might say), \n money is instead identified with a person's generic and invisible inner powers. \n I am not the first person to have made this point. Karl Marx said something similar more than a century ago.",

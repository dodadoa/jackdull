    "content": "It should be clearer now what I was getting at when I said that while Mauss's gifts are caught up in the specific social identity of their givers and receivers (their exterior \"image,\" one might say), money is instead identified with a person's generic and invisible inner powers. I am not the first person to have made this point. Karl Marx said something similar more than a century ago."
